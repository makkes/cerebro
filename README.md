# Cerebro - My Personal Knowledge Collection

This is my personal wiki-like collection of information on various topics. The resulting site is hosted at [cerebro.e13.dev](https://cerebro.e13.dev).

The site is generated using the awesome [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Running Locally

Run

```
hugo server -D
```

to run the site locally and view it in a browser.

## Updating the live Site

A [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/hugo.yml) keeps building and deploying the site using GitHub Pages upon every new commit pushed to the `main` branch.
