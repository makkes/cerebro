February 28, 2023

> The Sysdig Threat Research Team recently discovered a sophisticated cloud operation in a customer environment, dubbed
> SCARLETEEL, that resulted in stolen proprietary data.

[...]

> This attack was more sophisticated than most, as it started from a compromised Kubernetes container and spread to the
> victimâ€™s AWS account. The attackers also had knowledge of AWS cloud mechanics, such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
> roles, Lambda serverless functions, and Terraform.
